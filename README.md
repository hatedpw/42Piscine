# 42Piscine
My code from 42 ADEL Piscine. 

Before i started the piscine i had limited knowledge of coding besides the general structure and concepts from watching tons of different programming videos. 

I had some experience with python but nothing fancy just simple youtube tutorial stuff. 

I struggled so much starting c00 but once i got the structure concept in my head of void functions and void main i was able to smash through the tasks.

C00. 3 attempts. Final grade 75%
