# 42Piscine
My code from 42 ADEL Piscine. https://www.42adel.org.au/

The Piscine goes for 28 days, you jump in and learn with your peers learning how to code until your hearts content. The Piscine is designed in a way to be able to test if the 42 learning model is right for you and that you have what it takes.

During the pool, you will discover the basics of programming, from scratch. There are no prerequisites of any kind: you do not need prior experience, you do not need a diploma, as long as you are over 16 years of age. The pool is extremely stressful, challenging, frustrating, fun, and very, very intense. Don't expect a break on weekends.


Before i started the piscine i had limited knowledge of coding besides the general structure and concepts from watching tons of different programming videos. 
I had some experience with python but nothing fancy just simple youtube tutorial stuff. 

I struggled so much starting c00 but once i got the structure concept in my head of void functions and void main i was able to smash through the tasks.

Sadly our code did not pass the syntax check as we submitted in the final hour. But we were able to pass all the test cases and wouldve gotten 80% if not for the syntax failing!!!. Better luck next time!

We created a few of the files required for the task but ultimately decided as a group it was better to abandon this project due to time and knowledge constraints.

I didnt do very well in the exams, but i atleast passed them. I really wish i practiced more for these but with all the assignments  it was hard to find time.
